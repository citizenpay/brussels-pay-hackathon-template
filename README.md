## Project Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Brussels Pay hackathon project:

### 1. Install Brussels Pay App
Download and install the "Brussels Pay" app on your mobile phone:

- **iOS (iPhone/iPad)**: [Download from App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brussels-pay/id6742148784)
- **Android**: [Download from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=brussels.pay.wallet2&hl=en-US)

This app will be used to scan QR codes and confirm purchases. Brussels Pay is a local payment app specifically designed for the Brussels region, allowing you to support local businesses and make fast, contactless payments.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required modules:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the Project
Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 4. Test the Payment Flow
- Try confirming a purchase in the web application
- Scan the generated QR code with the Brussels Pay app
- Complete the payment flow to test the integration

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
